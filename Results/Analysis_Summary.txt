   - Probes with gene symbols: 16492
   - Final unique genes after averaging: 16364
   - Multiple probes mapping to same gene were handled by averaging expression values

2. DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS:
   - Comparison: Tumor vs Normal (Pancreatic Cancer)
   - Upregulated genes: 4
   - Downregulated genes: 14
   - Total significant DEGs: 18
   - Criteria: |logFC| > 1 and adj.P.Val < 0.05

3. NOTE:
   - Significant class imbalance: 241 Tumor vs 3 Normal samples
